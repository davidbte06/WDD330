        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><i>"If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and
                your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it'll
                be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful."</i> <b>Joel
                Marsh - The Hipper Element</b></p>
            <li>Design for mobile first</li>
            <p><i>"It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."</i> <b>
                Steve Jobs - Apple</b></p>
            <li>Observe what people are doing rather than just what they are saying that they want</li>
            <li>Reachability is very important - keys in the bottom</li>
            <li>Do not use pop-ups, especially on mobile sites</li>
            <li>Make adds small and simple</li>
            <li>Content first, ads second</li>
