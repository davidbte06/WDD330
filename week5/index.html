        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Why is it important to debug our code?</li>
            <li>Is there an efficient or better way to debug?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h3>

        <p>Debugging is a process of identifying and resolving bugs that may exist in our code. Many times we have found
            ourselves in the situation of making a code of a project and when we test it we realize that it does not
            work as we expected. So the next thing we do is to go to our code and look for the line that may be failing.
            That process is considered as debugging. Find what the error is, why it fails, how it failed and if it is
            affecting another part of the code.
        </p>

        <p>Errors are caused when something is not right in our program. Something a line or several lines may contain
            some problem that we must solve to make our program work. We can find some errors caused by the following
            reasons.</p>
        <li>System error: Problems with the system or external devices with wich the program is interacting</li>
        <li>Programmer error: The program contains incorrect syntax or fault logic</li>
        <li>User error: the user has entered data incorrectly</li>
        <li>Exceptions: this happens when an error produces a return value that can be used by the program to handle the
            error</li>
        <li>Make code fail gracefully but not completely silently, and so as to not affect user experience</li>
        <p>Strict mode: produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features - throws
            errors if sloppy code is used</p>
        <li>We just need to add to the first line of a JavaScript file - 'use strict';</li>
        <p>We can use Linting tools this helps us to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and
            will complain if certain style convetions are not followed, such as how code is indented</p>
        <li>We can add linting tool as a text-editor plugin</li>
        <p>There are always new APIs being developed and many times browsers are not keeping up with this. The way we
            can confirm browser support for these APIs is to use feture detection.</p>
        <li>The way of doing this is by using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying
            to actually call the method</li>
        <li>Modernizr and Can I use? are libraries to check which features are currently supported in different browsers
        </li>

        <p>An error can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs: const error = new Error ();</p>
        <p>Seven error objects used for specific errors:</p>
        <li>EvalError</li>
        <li>RangeError</li>
        <li>SyntaxError</li>
        <li>TypeError</li>
        <li>URIError</li>
        <li>InternalError</li>

        <p>We can also handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error: try, catch and finally</p>

        <li>Jest is a TDD framework: help us to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions</li>
