    <main>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How to create a function?</li>

            <li>How can we create more efficient functions?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <li>Programming is about making computers do what you want. A computer program is basically a series of
            instructions that tell your computer how to perform a task</li>
        <li>HTML5 is the latest HTML specification, though it’s actually more of an umbrella term for all the latest
            technologies that are used on the web. This includes HTML, CSS3 and lots of APIs that use JavaScript to
            interact with web pages.</li>
        <li>// short comment</li>
        <li>/* */ long comment</li>
        <li>Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory.</li>
        <li>A string is a collection of characters, such as letters and symbols. We can create a string literal by
            writing a group of characters inside quote marks like this: 'hello'</li>
        <li>Symbols were introduced as a new primitive value in ES6. They can be used to create unique values, which
            helps to avoid any naming collisions.</li>
        <li>Null means 'no value'. It can be thought of as a placeholder that JavaScript uses to say "there should be a
            value here, but there isn’t at the moment."</li>
        <li>There are two Boolean values: FALSE, TRUE</li>
        <li>Logical operators: !, &&, ||</li>
        <li>Arrays: An array is an ordered list of values.</li>
        <li>pop() : removes last item
        <li>shift() : removes first item</li>
        <li>push() : adds to end</li>
        <li>upshift() : add to beginning</li>
        <li>Loops: Loops will repeat a piece of code over and over again according to certain conditions.</li>
        <li>for (init; condition; after) {}</li>
        <li>for (const item of items) {}</li>
        <li>for (const key of items.keys()) {}</li>
        <li>for (const value of items.values()) {}</li>
        <li>for (const [key,value] of items.entries()) {}</li>
        <li>Function: A function is a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name, and is almost like a small,
            self-contained mini program. Functions can help reduce repetition and make code easier to follow.</li>
        <li>function hello() {
            console.log('Hello World'); }
        </li>
        <li>A function can also be declared using the constructor Function().</li>
        <li>Return Values: All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement, which comes
            after the return keyword. A function that doesn’t explicitly return anything (such as all the examples we
            have seen so far) will return undefined by default.</li>
        <li>Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the
            function as an input. There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the
            function is defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments.</li>
