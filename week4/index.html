        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
        <p>Forms are a very common, we use it when we log in to our favorite sites for example.</p>
        <li>We can create a form by using the tag form</li>
        <li>we can access form elements: const form = document.form[0];</li>
        <li>Forms have exclusive events: focus, blur, change</li>
        <li>Of course one of the most important events is the submit this occurs when the form is submitted</li>
        <p>Forms have controls for example: </p>
        <li>input, select, textarea, button</li>

        <p>We also have input fields, there are different types of input fields</p>
        <li>Text: The default type of input field is text, which is used for entering a short piece of text, such as a
            username.</li>
        <li>Password: is used to enter our passwords or secret information (input type='password')</li>
        <li>Checkbox: (type='checkbox') are used to select different options (true) or (false)</li>
        <li>Hidden Input Fields: (type='hidden') this type of input are not displayed by the browser but they have a
            value that contain information that is submitted when the form is submitted </li>
        <li>File Input Fields: (type='file') are used to upload files, Most of the browser will provide a button to
            select a file from their file system</li>
        <li>Other input fields: this are new inputs included in HTML5: number, tel, color</li>
        <li>Text Areas: is used to enter long text such a comment or blog post</li>
        <li>Buttons: there are different types of buttons, the default is submit</li>

        <h3>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects
            that have properties and methods, In object oriented programming, each object is capable of receiving
            messages, processing data and sending messages to other objects. Each object can be viewed as a small
            independent machine with a defined role or responsibility.</p>
        <li>Encapsulation: is a protection or isolation mechanism for attributes and methods.</li>
        <li>Polymorphism: is the ability of objects of a class to respond to the same message or event depending on the
            parameters used during its call.</li>
        <li>Inheritance: Inheritance allows new classes to be defined based on existing classes in order to reuse code,
            thus generating a hierarchy of classes within an application.</li>

        <h3>Chapter 15: Modern Javascript</h3>
        <li>Libraries: is a piece of code that provides methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks.</li>
        <li>jQuery is the most popular library used today</li>
        <li>An advantage of using a library is that the people already tasted and one disadvantage is that can cause
            perfomance issues.</li>
