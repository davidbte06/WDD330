        <h1>Week 3: Questions, Notes, Exercise</h1>
    </head>

    <main>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In javascript there are events of coordinates when we position our cursor in certain coordinates. When
                is this tool used?</li>
            <li>How to use events effectively?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Object Methods: this</h3>
        <p>Objects: Are usually created to represent entities of the real world</p>
        <p>We use (this) when we want to access the object. For instance:
            let user = {
            name: "Jhon",
            age: 30,

            sayHi() {
            alert(this.name)
            }
            };

            user.sayHi();
        </p>
        <p>We can use this in any function even if it's not a method of an object</p>
        <li>Arrow functions get 'this' from outer context</li>

        <h3>Chapter 5: Objects</h3>
        <li>An object whose properties are declared textually in the code is called an object literal.</li>
        <li>Objects can store methods inside them.</li>
        <li>To access the properties of an object inside a method it is necessary to use the reserved word this by
            variable scope.</li>

        <p>The way we create an object: const spiderman {}</p>
        <p>If we want to access the properties of an object we can use the dot notation For example: (superman.name)</p>
        <p>We also can Computed Properties for example:</p>
        <li>const hulk = { name: 'Hulk', ['catch' + 'Phrase']: 'Hulk Smash!' };</li>
        <p>We can call methods, checking if properties or methods exist, find all the properties of an object, add
            properties, change properties, remove properties</p>
        <p>Itâ€™s even possible for an object to contain other objects. (Nasted Objects)</p>

        <h3>Chapter 6: Document Object Model</h3>
        <p>What is the DOM?</p>
        <li>Means Document Object Model</li>
        <li>Represent an HMTL document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.</li>
        <p>The DOM help us to access any element on a page</p>
        <li>const body = document.body;</li>
        <li>(SetAttribute) help us to change the value of an element</li>

        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p>An event in javascript is a user action upon which some process can be performed (for example, changing
            the value of a form, or clicking on a link).</p>
        <li>(addEventListener) is used to register an event to a specific object.</li>
        <p>There are many types of events that can help us in different situations, from cursor coordinates, a click,
            touch, etc.</p>
