        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Are there any useful APIs not listed here that you would recommend?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h3>
        <p>Browser Object Model (BOM) is a collection of properties and methods and contain information about the
            browser and computer screen</p>
        <p>In general, you should refer to global variables without using the window object; it’s less typing and your
            code will be more portable between environments. An exception is if you need to check whether a global
            variable has been defined</p>
        <li>Global variables are created without using the const, let or var keywords</li>
        <li>Most browsers allow users to disable any dialogs from repeatedly appering, meaning they are not a feature to
            be relied upon</li>
        <li>window.location.href: return full URL</li>
        <p>With window.history we can access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser
            session</p>
        <li>window.history.length : shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page</li>
        <li>window.open() : we can open a new window</li>
        <li>window.screen: information about the screen the browser is displayed on, if we use (height) and (width) we
            can know the height and width of the screen in pixels</li>
        <p>Each window object contains a document object. The document object contains a few other methods that are
            worth looking at</p>
        <li>write(): simply writes a string of text to the page</li>
        <p>A cookie is a small piece of text that the websites you visit send to your browser. Cookies allow sites to
            remember information about your visit, which can make sites easier to revisit and more useful to you</p>
        <li>To create a cookie we need to assign it to JavaScript's, using the document.cookie</li>
        <li>document.cookie = 'name=Superman'</li>
        <p>Timing functions: setTimeout(), setInterval()</p>

        <h3>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs</h3>
        <p>HTML5 is the lastest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to creat web pages</p>
        <li>data: this is a way of embedding data in a web page and we use custom attributes that are ignored by the
            browser</li>
        <p>We can decide these attributes but we need to follow some rules</p>
        <li>Star with data</li>
        <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores</li>
        <li>Include an optional string value</li>
        <p>APIs that are popular and supported in most moder browsers</p>
        <li>HTML 5 Web Storage</li>
        <li>Geolocation</li>

        <p>The list of APIs is constantly growing, and includes APIs for accessing a device’s camera, uploading files,
            accessing the battery status, handling push notifications, building drag-and-drop functionality, creating 3D
            effects with WebGL, and many more! A comprehensive list of HTML5 APIs can be found at the Mozilla Developer
            Network</p>
